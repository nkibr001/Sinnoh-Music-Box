# Sinnoh-Music-Box
I wanted to make something dedicated to gen 4 for the sake of nostalgia haha
I drew everything except for the character and pokemon sprites (which were taken from the original games)
This was done in HTML, CSS, & Javascript.
Appears best in Chrome. (CSS doesn't get applied to Firefox for some reason).
My arm is in pain
